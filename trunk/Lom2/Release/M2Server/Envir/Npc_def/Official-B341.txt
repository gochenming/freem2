[@main]
Welcome to castle Gi-Ryoong.\
This castle has most facilities you could want\
so please make yourslef at home\
 <Listen/@listen1> to the history of the castle\
 <Listen/@listen2> to the newly discovered cave\
 <close/@exit>\ \

[@listen1]
This castle was built for suppressing the monsters, which\
have been found in massing near Woomyon woods and marauding\
through villages. Also it has the role of guarding the path\
which will soon open to the west. So the castle was built\
with through plans and has all the necessary facilities to\
be a top class fortress.\ \	
 <next/@next1>

[@next1]
However, the reinforcements from the other Walls were\
few and our reserves are running dangerously low,\
Furthremore, there are now unexpected threats that\
constantly appear around the castle, We desperately\
need help from people like you.\ \
 <next/@next2>

[@next2]
The court is even considering the option to let the young\
and brave people like you to run the castle. So please be\
conserned about the castle. I really hope that the authorities\
and the people come together and unite on all issues to\
overcome current difficulties.\ \

Where did you hear that story?\
hmm...It's no use to control the rumor.\
phew, If you want to know more,\
I'll tell you about the cave.\
where should I begin first...\ \
 <next/@next3>

[@next3]
It was when the construction of the castle\
was just completed. Our soldiers began mopping up\
the monsters by using the castle as a base.\
The first few days went smoothly but soon the\
soldiers on the patrol duty stopped returning to the castle.\ \
 <next/@next4>

[@next4]
Even the search and rescue team for the\
missing soldiers never returned. The military intelligence\
thought there must be massive forces of unknown monsters.\
So we begun searching the spots where the soldiers disappeared.\
Finally, we discovered traces of the missing soldiers\
leading towards one very mysterious cave.\ \
 <next/@next5>

[@next5]
General Bigmace, who was in charge of the castle at that\
time, led 70% of the Gi-Ryoong garrison to the cave to\
defeat the evil forces.\
And....that was the last time I saw him.\
Most of the expeditionary troop including the general were\
annihilated in the cave and only few managed to escape.\ \
 <next/@next6>

[@next6]
Dragon's vein..It is called Dragon's vein.\
thousands of soldiers got slaughtered and in return, our\
scholars were only able to discover that single name. Can\
you believe that? Even more..there is no one who knows\
what is really inside the cave. However, the most worrying\
thing of all is we are in deep trouble since we lost 70% of out\
garrison and are surrounded by the monsters we were supposed to\
hunt down.\ 
 <next/@next7>

[@next7]
The monsters, which lost their stongholds to us, are trying\
to take advantage of the situation and looking for an\
opportunity to destroy the castle. Phew....So we desperately\
need help from people like you.\ \
