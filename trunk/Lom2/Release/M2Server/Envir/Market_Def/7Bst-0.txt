You are looking for a cook? Sorry I know nothing about that\
sort of thing but I know where you might be able to find one.\
Apparently a cook lives in Serpent Village. Try looking there.\
Good luck.\ \

 What Items do you need?\ \ \
 <Back/@main>

[@sell]
 I deal with Candles, RandomTeleports,\
 DungeonEscapes and so on.\ \
 <Back/@main>

[@ask]
 I deal with <Candle/@candle>,<Dungeonescape/@dungeonescape>,\
 <RandomTeleport/@randomteleport>,<RepairOil/@repairoil> and so on forth.\
 I have heard that there are <Townteleport/@townteleport> which come\
 from monsters only\ \
 <Back/@normal>

[@candle]
Candles are needed when it's dark. without a candle\
you can not see anything-even your foot for darkness.\ \
<Back/@ask>

[@dungeonescape]
A Dungeonescape scroll is a magic paper that moves you promptly\
to certain fields near the last village you visited.\
The power of Dungeonescape scroll is weak compared with\
TownTeleport scrolls but it could still save your liefe.\ \
<Back/@ask>

[@randomteleport]
A Randomteleport scroll is a magic paper that can\
make you randonly move to another place in the same map.\
For example if you were in a dungeon 1st floor, you will\
move to another place on that floor by using the RT.\
If situation is dangerous but you still have potions, use this\
to help you out of a tight situation.\ \
<Back/@ask>

[@repairoil]
A RepairOil makes the durabillity of you hand weapon rise,\
but this oil doesn't special repair your weapon, so
remember that then maximum durabillity of the weapon\
goes down as time goes by.\
If the weapon at your hand was not expensive,\
repair with this oil sometimes during hunting.\
This will make hunts last longer.\ \
<Back/@ask>

[@townteleport]
TownTeleport scrolls carn't be made now because the ancient\
skill is lost.... however....\
I have heard that it may come randomly from Monsters\
and you can return to a village promptly by using it...\ \
<Back/@ask>
