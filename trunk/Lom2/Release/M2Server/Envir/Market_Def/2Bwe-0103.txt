[@qweapon]
 When you buy a store weapon, it has some limits to its performance.\
 However, weapons acquired from monsters (when they drop them after\
 being slain), occasionally have a higher rating. If you bring any\
 such weapons to me, I will usually offer a better price for it.\
 Remember that an item's proce is depepndent upon it's condition. if\
 it has high durability, it's selling proce is usually higher.\
