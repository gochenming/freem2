[@Q707]
You received books already, didn't you ??   as you got books \
Click a book called by Fireball twice (click twice the left button of mouse) \
Then as the book disappears you master the skill \
Hitting F11 button, you can check your martial art skill \
How to set up your martial art skill is that after hitting martial art picture , select key button \ 
Now go and visit Bookstore at Bichon province \
The owner of Bookstore will advise you how to develop yourself \ \
