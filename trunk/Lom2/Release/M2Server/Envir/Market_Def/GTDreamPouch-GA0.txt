Hello. This is the territory of <$AGITGUILDNAME> guild!\
The Dream Pouch I made can only be used by the members of\
<$AGITGUILDNAME> guild! And remember, the images displayed through\
the Dream Pouch are all illusions, not real.\ \
<Check/@ga_decomon_count> the number of <images/@images.>\
<Purchase/@ga_decoitem_buy> a Dream Pouch.    <Sell/@sell> the Dream Pouch.\
<Listen to/@listen> Domitian's story.\
<Learn/@learn> how to use the Dream Pouch.

[@images]
#SAY
The images that re displayed through the Pouch\
are created by your dream and imagination.\
Although they are not real,\
how wonderfull it is to have dreams about them.\
You shouldn't lose your dream and draw many things in your mind too.\ \

#SAY
Do you believe in the mysterious force of dragons?\
There are many unrevealed secrets in this Mir continent.\
I have researched the force of dragons for decades.\
You may have heard about the 'dragon's vein,'\
the flow of the dragon's gigantic force.\
<Next/@next1>

[@next1]
#SAY
It wouldn't make sence if you didn't know about such things,\
when you live in Mir continent. The force that flows through\
the Dragon's vein protects each and every part of the continent,\
although there are mutated monsters emerging\
from somewhere because of the force.\
<Next/@next2>

[@next2]
#SAY
It is also because of the force from the Dragon's vein,\
that human settlements survived and Mirian fighters can\
become strong through training.\
However, one of the 7 Dragon's veins has been contaminated\
with evil force after the invasion of the once powerful Omas.\
We call this place the 'Evil Dragon's Vein'\ \
<Next/@next3>

[@next3]
#SAY
Thanks to the Oma invasion, We were able to discover\
one of the 7 locations of Dragon's vein.\
Although it is contaminated with evil force and\
I had no exact coordinates for the location,\
there is no doubt it is still filled with the power of Dragon.\
So I began searching for the place by following the Oma trails.\ \
<Next/@next4>

[@next4]
#SAY
For my research, I risked my life by going deep into\
the Evil Dragon's vein. After collecting some dirt,\
I put them into a pouch and carried them back to the Tao village.\
The Taoists there all helped and supported my research in every way.\
But one day! When I was invited to a guild territory\
by the guild master and I visited there,\
I spilled some dirt by mistake.\ \
<Next/@next5>

[@next5]
#SAY
And then, an image of a dragon suddenly appeared.\
Scared by its gigantic size, I flopped to the ground...\
Then it mysteriously disappeared... Yes... It was an illusion...\
Do you know why the illusion took place?\
It's because of... this place...\ \
<Next/@next6>

[@next6]
#SAY
This guild territory is a purified and sacred place\
where evil things cannot exist. And the force of the Dragon's\
vein met this holy place, It caused the mysterious illusion.\
Once I put the dirt in this sacred magic pouch while thinking\
about flowers, beautiful flowers appeared before my eyes\
when I sprinkled them in the places!\
Just like that, the illusion of the Dragon at the time appeared because\
I was thinking about the legendary Dragon all the time.\ \
<Next/@next7>

[@next7]
#SAY
This is...just what I found out by devoting half my life...\
It is just a small part of the force of Dragon's vein.\
Nobody knows what could be discovered next.\
My heart is already throbbing for the protential power around it...\
I will find out by sacrificing all my life.\
And... I believe in the enormous, sacred power of the Dragon...\ \
<Back/@main>

[@learn]
#SAY
If you drop a Dream Pouch on desired spot,\
the image will appear.\
If a guild member uses the pouch, the location can\
only be modified within 2 minutes after the use.\
After 2 minutes, only the guild master can change the location.\ \
<Next/@next>

[@next]
#SAY
In order to change the location of the image,\
move to the center of the image and pick up the image\
from the ground and then turn it back to a Dream Pouch again.\
The image will last for a week.\
The number of decorative items allowed for both inner\
and outer guild territory is limited to total 50.\
Purchase screen can be managed with arrow keys.\
